# Crypto Clustering

This notebook will cluster cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods and visually show the results via plots. This will give the company a better idea on which cryptocurrencies to group together in portfolios for better overall performance by using the additional data instead of just the returns and volatility. This should help generate a more broad picture and help with the grouping of these cryptocurrencies.

## Usage

To access the crypto clustering notebook, please begin by typing jupyter lab in your terminal. 

```python
jupyter lab
```

Next, find the folder with the notebook(crypto_investments.ipynb) and double click it to open the notebook in a new launcher. Then, begin running through each section of the application to get the appropriate data.

Once in the notebook it will take you through a step-by-step process as it Collects the Data, Prepares the Data, and Analyzes the Data.
You will be granted Visualizations along the way to help better see and understand the data.

We do believe everything is thoroughly explained in the notebook, but please let us know if you have any further questions.
